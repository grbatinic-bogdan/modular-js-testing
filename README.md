# Modular JS testing/playground

This is an implementation built from [LearnCode.academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy) tutorial about [modular](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABs-wDaaxChu82q_xQgUb4f) JavaScript. I adapted it a bit according to my tastes:
- Dropped jQuery support
- Added gulp for build process
- Added bootstrap

## Usage

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Build modules: `gulp`

Watch module changes `gulp watch`
