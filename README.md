# Modular JS testing/playground

This is an implementation built from [LearnCode.academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy) tutorial about modular JavaScript. I adapted it a bit according to my tastes:
- Dropped jQuery support
- Added gulp for build process

## Usage

Install dependencies: `npm install`
Build modules: `gulp`
Watch module changes `gulp watch`
